# VulScanner

VulScanner is a **Go-based service** that scans a GitHub repository for JSON files containing vulnerability data, stores them in an **SQLite database**, and allows querying based on severity.

## Features

âœ… **Scan API** (POST `/scan`): Fetches and processes JSON vulnerability reports from a GitHub repository.  
âœ… **Query API** (POST `/query`): Retrieves stored vulnerabilities filtered by severity.  
âœ… **Concurrency**: Processes multiple files in parallel for efficiency.  
âœ… **Error Handling**: Retries GitHub API calls (up to **2 times**) upon failure.  
âœ… **Docker Support**: Runs as a single-container service.  
âœ… **Testing**: Achieves **70%+ test coverage**.
