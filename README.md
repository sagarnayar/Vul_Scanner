# VulScanner

VulScanner is a **Go-based service** that scans a GitHub repository for JSON files containing vulnerability data, stores them in an **SQLite database**, and allows querying based on severity.

## Features

✅ **Scan API** (POST `/scan`): Fetches and processes JSON vulnerability reports from a GitHub repository.  
✅ **Query API** (POST `/query`): Retrieves stored vulnerabilities filtered by severity.  
✅ **Concurrency**: Processes multiple files in parallel for efficiency.  
✅ **Error Handling**: Retries GitHub API calls (up to **2 times**) upon failure.  
✅ **Docker Support**: Runs as a single-container service.  
✅ **Testing**: Achieves **70%+ test coverage** with unit and integration tests.

## 📌 **Testing Instructions**

### **Automated Testing**
Run the following command to execute tests and check test coverage:
```sh
go test ./... -cover
```
- Unit tests cover core functionalities, including JSON parsing and database operations.  
- Integration tests validate API behavior with simulated GitHub responses.  
- Test coverage report ensures code reliability and stability.  

### **Manual Testing**
1. **Run the service** using `./vulscanner`.
2. **Test Scan API:**
   - Use Postman or `curl` to send a POST request to `/scan` with a valid GitHub repo URL.
   - Verify that JSON files are processed and stored in SQLite.
3. **Test Query API:**
   - Send a GET request to `/query` with appropriate filters.
   - Verify that relevant JSON data is returned.
